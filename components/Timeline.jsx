              Completed my university education. During my time in university, I
              had the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge and skills in my
              field of study. This education provided me with a strong
              foundation that has helped me to pursue my career goals and

              I participated in a hackathon event hosted by iHub, a technology
              and innovation hub in Nairobi, Kenya. The event focused on
              developing innovative solutions to challenges faced by small and
              medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the region. My team developed a
              mobile app prototype that provides SMEs with real-time market data
              and analytics to help them make informed business decisions.
